My experiments with Graph Neural Nets at the scratch level.

## GCN Implementation in PyTorch


## GCN Implementation in C++

This is a C++ implemetation from scratch for the GCN layer. The C++ implementation only comes with a forward pass over the model which doesn't involve any training and backpropagation. The weights learnt for the same model trained in Python using PyTorch and `PyTorch Autograd` are utilized for the C++ implementation.
